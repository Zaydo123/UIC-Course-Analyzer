# UIC Grade Data Analyzer

## Description

This program is designed to analyze and visualize grade distribution data of various courses offered at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). The purpose is to assist students in making informed decisions regarding course and professor selections by providing insights based on historical grading data. By evaluating the grading trends, pass rates, and withdrawal rates, students can choose courses and instructors that align best with their academic goals.

## Features

- **Course Search:** Users can search for courses by course code and number, professor's name, or department.
- **Grade Distribution Visualization:** The program generates bar graphs visualizing the grade distribution (A, B, C, D, F) for each searched course.
- **Performance Metrics:** For each course, the program calculates and displays metrics such as:
  - Average letter grade
  - Pass rate
  - Fail rate
  - Withdrawal rate

## Usage Instructions

1. **Setup:**
    - Ensure that you have the necessary modules installed: `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
    - Place the CSV files containing the UIC grade data in a specific directory.
    - Ensure that the CSV files are named in the following format: `SEMESTER YEAR.csv` (e.g. `Fall 2023.csv`).
    - Update CSV_PATH in `main.py` to the path of the directory containing the CSV files.

2. **Execution:**
    - Run the program.
    - You'll be prompted to enter the Course Subject Code and Course Number.
    - The program will then display the results in the console and save grade distribution bar graphs as PNG files in the specified directory.

3. **Example:**
   ```bash
   Enter Course Subject Code: CS
   Enter Course Number: 100
   ```
